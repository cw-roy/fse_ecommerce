            <h1>I love coffee.</h1>
            <p>Coffee, the liquid gold that's often referred to as the nectar of the gods, is truly a lifesaver for many
                of us. It's like a warm hug in a mug that jumpstarts our engines in the morning and keeps us going
                throughout the day. In fact, some of us might argue that it's the only thing that stands between us and
                becoming a grumpy, sleep-deprived monster. It's so essential that if coffee disappeared from the face of
                the earth, we'd probably have to rename our planet "Depresso" or "Yawnington". So, let's all raise a cup
                to this miraculous elixir that makes life a little more bearable - Cheers to coffee, the beverage that
                makes our day, one cup at a time!</p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="card" role="region" aria-label="Card: Just a cup of plain light roast coffee">
                    <img src="images/cuppa_joe.png" alt="plain coffee">
                    <div>
                        <h2><b>Just a cuppa</b></h2>
                        <p>Plain and simple.</p>
                        <p>Light roast coffee is like the shy cousin of medium and dark roast coffee - it's lighter in
                            color and has a delicate, subtle flavor profile that lets the natural bean flavors shine
                            through. Perfect for those who value the unique quirks of different coffee varieties, 
                            and who want a coffee that won't slap them in the face with its boldness.</p>

                        <p>Just like at Mel's.</p>
                        <p>Medium roast coffee is like the Goldilocks of coffee roasts, not too light and not too dark,
                            but just right. It's the perfect balance of sweet and sour, and the moderate caffeine
                            content won't leave you bouncing off the walls like a hyperactive kangaroo.</p>

                            enough of its comforting taste. So next time you need a caffeine fix and a donut to go

                        <p>Not spelled with an X.</p>
                        <p>Espresso is the amped version of coffee â€“ super concentrated and made by blasting
                            hot water through finely ground beans at high pressure. The result? A tiny but mighty shot
                            with a thick layer of crema on top, packing a rich, intense flavor that's perfect for making
                            popular drinks like cappuccinos and lattes. And let's be real, we all know it's the ultimate
                            pick-me-up that coffee lovers around the world can't get enough of!</p>

                        <p>Dark as sin.</p>
                        <p>Extra dark roast coffee is like the Lucifer of the coffee world - bold, intense, and not for
                            the faint of heart. It's roasted for so long that it's practically a different species from
                            its lighter-roasted cousins. If you're looking for a coffee that can handle a little bit of
                            cream and sugar and still punch you in the taste buds, extra dark roast is your go-to. Just
                            don't expect it to be delicate or nuanced - this coffee is all about power and strength.</p>
